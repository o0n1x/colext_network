Rename project in colext_config.yaml to slwr
Added COLEXT_DEVICE_TYPE
Reverted back to python3.8
- Best way to add a custom python is probably through conda.
Previous experiment didn't use GPU...
- So what were those values...? Graphical interface?
Addressed client not connecting to flserver
- On restart, DNS was still pointing to last dead server
I was accidentaly only collecting gpu metrics once a second
Metric collection time now takes into account time to gather metrics

Remove lines with torch from requirements.txt

<!-- Latest -->
Added configuration of monitoring to the colext config
CoLExT now captures start-end time of rounds (FIT/EVAL) :+1:

# DB Changelog
fl_testbed_logging.clients_in_rounds -> fl_testbed_logging.clients_in_round
fl_testbed_logging.rounds -> renamed accuracy to dist_accuracy + added srv_accuracy

Can we remove client in round id? That id grows very fast. it's already 18k
    We can replace cir_id with three unique foreign keys (job_id, client_id, round_id)


Generic image now uses a base pytorch image with pytorch 2.0.1 comes with python3.10 vs 3.8 in the jetsons
